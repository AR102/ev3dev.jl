# ev3dev.jl

This is a package for controlling an EV3 Brick in Julia. As Julia doesn't run on the architecture of the EV3-Brick yet, another computer connected to the Brick is required. We personally use a Raspberry Pi and originally made the package for it but any computer / SoC capable of running Julia and with enough performance should work as well.

We will further refer to the EV3-Brick as "brick" and the connected computer as "computer".

## Required Material

- An EV3-Brick
- A SD-Card
